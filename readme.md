rohdeschwarz
============
An instrument control library for general purpose Rohde & Schwarz instruments, and in particular the Vector Network Analyzer.

The package is still in development; as such, it may change at any time. I recommend that you "freeze" to a particular version of the package once you get your software working.

Requirements
------------
`rohdeschwarz` is python 2.7/3 compatible. It requires the following packages:
- pathlib
- pyvisa
- numpy
